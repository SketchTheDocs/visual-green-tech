## Purpose

The website will broadly explore visual storytelling as a tool for increasing awareness and action around sustainability practices and sustainable software engineering (_greentech_) in our communities and workplaces.

_Visual Storytelling_ refers to the use of visual elements (fonts, graphics, composition, color) to create content (sketchnotes, visual metaphors, characters) that help make a complex message easier to understand, retain, and recall. This can include:
 
  1. `Visual Guides` | sketchnotes that provide "big picture" overviews of content.
  2. `Visual Glossary` | visual puzzles that explain terms or concepts in fun ways.
  3. `Visual Prompts` | content challenges to promote self-learning & sharing.

## Catalyst

The [#VisualGreenTech Challenge](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/visualgreentech-challenge-earthday-2021/ba-p/2257548?WT.mc_id=mobile-24661-ninarasi) was launched in April 2021 as a precursor to the #EarthDay celebrations on Apr 22. The objective was to increase user awareness and action around sustainability practices in home, work, and community environments. And the approach involved sharing one prompt a day (for 24 days) encouraging readers to explore a specific resource, and share their learnings with a visual.

Each prompt led the user to a specific resource for self-exploration - including:

 * [#VisualGreenTech Challenge: Earth Day 2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/visualgreentech-challenge-earthday-2021/ba-p/2257548?WT.mc_id=mobile-24661-ninarasi) - _Microsoft Green Tech Blog_.

## Hello Earth!

The challenge was created as a collaboration between the Green Advocacy team and members of the HelloWorld teams, leading up to a special [#EarthDay themed show](https://dev.to/azure/hello-world-hello-earth-1f8l) on April 22, 2021. The VisualGreenTech challenge was launched April 1 during #ABSee, a segment that explores tech with a visual storytelling focus, and features interactive visual puzzles.

Watch the #ABSee segments of Hello World all through April for shout-outs to the challenge, with a special #EarthDay episode featuring community created submissions.

# The #VisualGreenTech challenge 

The [#VisualGreenTech Challenge](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/visualgreentech-challenge-earthday-2021/ba-p/2257548?WT.mc_id=mobile-24661-ninarasi) was launched in April 2021 as a precursor to the #EarthDay celebrations on Apr 22. The objective was to increase user awareness and action around sustainability practices in home, work, and community environments. And the approach involved sharing one prompt a day (for 24 days) encouraging readers to explore a specific resource, and share their learnings with a visual.
